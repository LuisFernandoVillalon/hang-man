# Hang-Man Java Application
My final project for my Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Java class in college. 

# Summary
The application's GUI displays asterisks representing the word's letters and an empty hanger. 
Correct guesses replace asterisks, while wrong ones reveal a new body part on the hangman figure. 
The game ends when the stick-figure is complete, signifying loss, or when the entire word is guessed, 
resulting in victory. I applied everything I was taught, including implementing polymorphism based on the inheritance 
properties within the data hierarchy. Javafx was used to to create the graphical user interface (GUI)
for the user to interact with the data. Images were used to represent the stick figure.
